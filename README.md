# A-CNN-Based-method-for-Anime-Characters-face-expressions-classification

- CNN1-drop.ipynb,CNN2-drop.ipynb,CNN3-drop.ipynb are training code of three subnets.
- CNN1.ipynb,CNN2.ipynb,CNN3.ipynb are training code of three subnets without dropout layer.
- CNN-mix-drop.ipynb is the ensemble model training code.
- detect_example.py is a pyqt5 interface for Anime Character Expression Recognization.
- detect_faces is our dataset on Anime Character Expression Recognization with seven labels.
- Our trained model parameters can be accessed at Releases.
- We made a simple image recognition interface using CNN Ensemble model at epoch50 through pyqt5:
